# My-interactions

This application allows users to create profiles to research and store drug interactions behind a secure and personal login.

## User Story

As a user I want to see if the drugs and supplements that I take, or could take, will have interactions with one another drug. As a private individual I would like to know the results of my search privately and not on a public browser's search. I would also like to reference back to my previous inputs and store them to my account.
